* Emacs

** Requirements

The config relies on features that are built-in in ~emacs >= 29~ (use-package, tree-sitter, eglot, ... ([[file:emacs.org::*which-key][which-key]] in ~emacs >= 30.1~))

There are a lot of packages required to build from source, in the next distro hopping session (or hopefully in a new computer) i'll write down all requirements. 

Besides that, the config requires:
- [[https://github.com/source-foundry/Hack][Hack]] and [[https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/tree/master/patched-fonts/Hack][Hack Nerd]] Fonts
- [[https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Color+Emoji][Noto Color Emoji]] Font (emojis ðŸ¥³)
- ~tree-sitter~
- ~cmake~, ~libtool~ and ~libvterm~ (vterm)
- ~enchant~ and ~pkgconf~ (jinx)

** Building from source

Get the latest emacs version and install it:

#+begin_src sh
  git clone https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/emacs.git
  ./autogen.sh
  ./configure --with-imagemagick --with-tree-sitter --with-native-compilation=aot
  make
  make install
#+end_src

Then create the emacs config folder:

#+begin_src sh
  mkdir -p ~/.config/emacs
#+end_src

Then open the [[file:emacs.org][emacs.org]] file in emacs and tangle it (~C-c C-v C-t~)!

** Language servers

- Python: ~pyright~
- C: ~clangd~
- C#: ~csharp-ls~
- Javascript: ~typescript-language-server~
- HTML and CSS: ~vscode-langservers-extracted~
- Java: ~jdtls~

** Spell Checkers

I'm using [[http://aspell.net/][aspell]] for english and [[https://github.com/hunspell/hunspell][hunspell]] for portuguese.

* BSPWM

[[https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm][bspwm]] is a window manager that represents windows as leaves of a full binary search tree.

The entire setup needs the following packages:
- ~bspwm~
- ~sxhkd~
- ~dmenu~
- ~polybar~

  
The bspwm configuration is stored in ~/.config/bspwm/bspwmrc~, you need to create that directory if it doesn't exist yet, link the ~bspwmrc~ script to the right location, and change its permissions:

#+begin_src sh
  mkdir -p ~/.config/bspwm
  ln -s ~/.dotfiles/bspwmrc ~/.config/bspwm/bspwmrc
  chmod +x ~/.config/bspwm/bspwmrc
#+end_src

** sxhkd

[[https://github.com/baskerville/sxhkd][sxhkd]] handles input for bspwm, the configuaration file is stored in ~/.config/sxhkd/sxhkdrc~, you also need to create the directory and link the configuartion file.

#+begin_src sh
  mkdir -p ~/.config/sxhkd
  ln -s ~/.dotfiles/sxhkdrc ~/.config/sxhkd/sxhkdrc
#+end_src

** polybar

[[https://github.com/polybar/polybar][polybar]] is an easy to configure status bar.

The *polybar* directory in this repo contains the configuation file ([[file:polybar/config.ini][config.ini]]) and the launch script ([[file:polybar/launch.sh][launch.sh]]) that is called inside BSPWM's config file. You need to link the directory to ~~/.config/polybar~ and change permissions to execute the script.

#+begin_src sh
  ln -s ~/.dotfiles/polybar ~/.config/polybar
  chmod +x ~/.config/polybar/launch.sh
#+end_src
